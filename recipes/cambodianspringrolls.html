<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rice paper roll filled with vegtables and rice noodle. Some see it as an appetizer<br>
but if you eat more then a few it can easily become a healthy meal.<br>
The sauce is a mix of fish sauce, sugar and vinegar. The sweet and salty semi sour sauce is what ties this dish together.
